# Mars Formatting Conventions (This Repo)

## Scope

This skill covers **formatting only**: running `stylua` and verifying
format. It does NOT cover code correctness, linting, or commit style. Do NOT
run `:checkhealth`, `:messages`, or `:Lint` unless explicitly asked.

## Lua

Run `stylua .` before committing Lua changes.

- Indent: 2 spaces
- Column width: 120
- Configuration: `stylua.toml`

## Other File Types

Markdown, JSON, and TOML formatting in this repo is handled by editor
defaults and LSP. No manual CLI formatter steps are required.

## Format Verification

In Neovim, format the current buffer:

```vim
:MarsFormat
```

Inspect resolution (which binary was picked and why) via `:checkhealth
mars`.
